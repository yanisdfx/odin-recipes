    <h2> Description</h2>

    <p>The quiche Lorraine is a traditional French savory tart that originates from the Lorraine region in northeastern France. It features a buttery, flaky pastry crust filled with a rich mixture of eggs, cream, and smoked bacon (lardons). </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 shortcrust pastry (or pie crust)</li>
        <li>Smoked Bacon</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>Emmental cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Roll out the pastry and place it in a tart pan. Prick the bottom with a fork and pre-bake it for about 10 minutes (this prevents it from getting soggy).</li>
        <li>Cook the bacon in a pan until golden and slightly crispy. Drain the excess fat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, and milk. Add salt, pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Spread the bacon evenly over the pastry crust. If you’re using cheese, sprinkle it on top.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture over the filling.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 30–35 minutes, or until the top is golden and the filling is set.</li>
        <li>Let it cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
