    <h2> Description</h2>

    <p>Crème Brûlée is a classic French dessert featuring a rich custard base topped with a layer of caramelized sugar.  </p>
    <p>Smooth, creamy, and slightly sweet, it’s often flavored with vanilla and served chilled, offering a perfect contrast between the silky custard and the crunchy caramel top.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (480 ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean (or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar (plus extra for caramelizing)</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
        <li>Heat the cream with the split vanilla bean (or vanilla extract) until warm, but not boiling. Remove from heat and let it infuse for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg yolks with sugar and a pinch of salt until smooth and pale.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the warm cream into the egg mixture while stirring continuously.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture to remove any lumps or vanilla bean pieces.</li>
        <li>Pour into ramekins and place them in a baking dish. Fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins (water bath).</li>
        <li>Bake for 35–40 minutes, until the custard is set but still slightly wobbly in the center.</li>
        <li>Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, sprinkle sugar on top and caramelize with a kitchen torch or under a broiler until golden and crispy.</li>
    </ol>
